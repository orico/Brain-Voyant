# Brain Pattern Classifier
A tool for classifying whole-brain patterns from fMRI RAW DICOM data in real-time (and offline) based on machine learning methods.
We use supervised whole-brain data, without prior knowledge of regions of interest (ROIs) to converge on the relevant voxels. 
i.e., our tool will figure out which voxels are contributing to the task and choose them automatically.
The Visual C# code enables you to build an application that uses a .prt protocol and accepts raw-based Dicom files from turbo-brain-voyager for the purpose of creating a machine learning classifier using SVM and IG for feature selection.
it does a bunch of other things, please look at the following papers for details. 
if you plan on using this code for experimental purposes and write a paper, please cite paper #4.
                                                                                                                           
** please note that there are some missing libraries, which will be added later.
